# AirBnB clone

A project to create a simple clone of the [AirBnB website](https://airbnb.com).
Not all the components will be implement.

## console

This is the first part.
Manipulation of objects are done at this point.

The following objects are manipulated:

	- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
	- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
	- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
	- Update attributes of an object
	- Destroy an object

A parent `class` called `BaseModel` is created here.
This will take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization.

A simple flow of data will be created at this point.

Some of the classes that will be created at this point is:

	- User
	- State
	- City
	- Place
	- e.t.c

Create a file storage type of thing and create unittests (some of them are from the community).
